# Conclusion

## Data mining/Big Data competitions are uniquely rewarding

- They provide an opportunity to learn a set of experiences that are hard to find elsewhere

- They require no long term commitment but you might develop some skills or habits that persist (forever)

- Constraints and difficulty force creativity in multiple areas

# Conclusion

## The nature of the competitions reward specific habits

- Frequent meetings keep people in the loop as the competition progresses/changes

- Early focus should be on getting everyone working as close to the raw data as is feasible

- Keep an eye on the deadline, but don't let it lead you to block creative ideas

- Keep the team as flat as possible, outside of organizational tasks, for most of the competition.

- If you have a strong solution as the deadline looms, flip things over: everyone falls in line and does whatever the team leader says
