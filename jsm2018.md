## Why I Started
- Took two data mining courses during the same semester
- My professors encouraged participation
- The team I joined came in 5th Place in the Data Mining Cup 

## Spiral up
- Eventually participated in about a dozen competitions over the next 3 years
- Some successes, some failure
- First place in the Data Mining Cup

## What I Learned by Competing
Regardless of how the team ultimately did, I always got something out of it
- I learned a lot of programming things (git, R, databases)
- I learned a lot about working with real data (creating features, etc)
- I learned a lot about working in a team (keeping motivated)

## The Perfect Test Environment
- These competitions provide a great opportunity to test ideas
- They attract a competitors from a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds
- Here's they key: they end. It's not your thesis, it's not your job, you aren't stuck

## You Get What You Need
- Practice, practice, practice
If you want to get better at something 
It's What You WantYou Have a Chance

types of competitions and I think it's because dIt's possible that no matter what I did

And here's The key takeaway is that I got this 

**
got a lot of information about math skThe competitions gave me a chance to learn things I wouldn't have learned in norma situations
- Software skills for instance
-

Data mining competitions create a unique opportunity 
`
** You are working with real data **

-  Has the data been processed and homogenized? Variables stripped of meaning? That's awful! It's also real.

-  Is the data messy? Is it hard to understand what the variables even mean? That's real too.

-  Is the data awkward to work with? Is it levels beyond "big", strangely structured? (shh, that's real).

** You are working on a real problem **

-  Somebody, somewhere decided the best way to answer whatever question is posed by the competition is (believe it or not) to make a bunch of people compete with each other

## Big Data Competitions

** You are working on a problem that is open path **

-  You are _literally_ creating a solution - that means you get to be creative.

-  Big Data Comps are _not_ job postings or homework assignments - there aren't a specific set of skills they're looking for

-  The path to a solution has not been layed out for you and that means the skills/techniques you will use haven't been chosen for you

-  Things you learned in 502 and other big data courses will almost certainly be useful!

-  Things you learned in time-series? Bayes? 500?

-  Physics? Biology? Wasting time on Amazon?

-  Building a prediction is a long process and you get to put you're stamp on it.

## Big Data Competitions

** You are working on a problem that is closed answer **

-  Even though the way you get to a solutions is completely open, the final solution is closed

-  Everyone is evaluated on the same scale even if the path to the top is open ended. 

-  This is good if you are competitive - you actually have competition.

-  This is good if you are not competitive - because you can actually evaluate your approach.

## My Experiences

Working on competitions like Kaggle and the DMC gave me:

###Data Mining Experience
-  A better understanding of why we need Machine Learning techniques
-  A chance to apply what I was learning without any guardrails
-  A chance to learn from others who had been through this before

###Collaborative Practice
- I got the chance to work hard at something because people were depending on me
- People working together on the same problem disagree - we had to resolve conflicts and move on
- Our solution is the hard work of several people, all woven together

## Meetings

You *have* to have meetings

-  People don't read emails, people don't look at each others updates

-  Schedule them during a regular time

You *have* to have a lot of meetings

-  Once a week isn't going to work - too easy to put off

-  Twice a week to three times a week is good for big group meetings.

-  Meet in pairs as the chance arises: getting with team members to look over problems, etc.

-  Example: I used to talk to Cory a lot during our first DMC even during off hours

## Working Together

**Don't worry too much about repeating efforts**

No team I have ever been a part of was undone by people doing the same thing

-  You repeat efforts when there are only k things to do and n people to do them

-  That's not these competitions - there is not set of things to do

-  What you are doing is complicated - if we both "do a random forest" there are still perhaps dozens of ways to do it

-  You'd spend your whole time telling other people what you are doing 

-  The first 100 things everyone does are the same anyway (this is good)

## Working Together

** Everybody works with the raw data **

This is connected to the idea that the first 100 things you do are going to be the same

-  I've seen groups go "give us a King" who will prepare and filter our data for us

-  It _never_ works out the way they want it to. Instead it does this:

   -  The person "controlling" the data overwhelmed by the responsibility, becomes a bottleneck and people resent them (revolution)
   -  The data becomes alien to the people who don't work with the raw form and they are reduced to being servers running code (tyranny)

## Working Together

** Don't Delegate, Do Work Together, Do Volunteer **

-  Delegating doesn't work

   -  My general impression is that people do and probably should resent this

   -  Also: who decides what to delegate? Who knows that much?

-  If you have an idea but aren't sure how to implement it:

   -  Bring it up at the team meetings (so vital)

   -  See if someone doesn't know how to do it (work together)

   -  If someone has an idea you could help on, do so

## The Data Mining Cup GitHub Page

I will now take you on a brief tour of the Data Mining Cup's GitHub page. We used GitHub as our main tool to organize.  These competitions have the same flow as a Chess:

**The Early Game**

   -  Exploring the data
   -  Comprehending the fundamental challenges
   -  Getting a sense of the structure 
   -  Simple predictions

**The Middle Game**

   -  Building a feature matrix
   -  First steps in prediction

**The Late Game**

   -  Better predictions
   -  Combining predictions

The Data Mining Cup is a yearly competition hosted by prudsys (all lower case) a German analytics company
focused on marketplace behavior. prudsys describes it this way:

> The DATA MINING CUP (DMC for short) has been inspiring students around the world to pursue intelligent data analysis since the year 2000.
> In 2014 over one thousand students from about 100 universities in 28 countries took part in the competition.
> The best teams will be invited to Berlin for the awards ceremony at the prudsys personalization summit.

##In Spring 2013 I was taking STAT 602
- And 602 was really, really hard.
- So hard that I didn't even **look** at the midterm when I got it back
- But I knew that "data mining" was important and I liked it
- I just needed a chance to prove to myself that I could do it

##That's when I joined the Data Mining Cup Team
And as if by magic STAT 602 started making much more sense.
Without the big complicated data sets, 
it's hard to see where these theories and techniques matter. 
But working with these datasets takes up so much time, 
the methods become bizarre black boxes.
Working at the DMC gave me:
###Data Mining Experience
- A better understanding of why we need Machine Learning techniques
- A chance to apply what I was learning without any guardrails
- A chance to learn from others who had been through this before

###Better Computing Skills
- The problems you have to deal with are often computational, and you get better at working through them
- I got much better at R during this competition (I learned how to use `knitr` for instance)

###Collaborative Skills
- I got the chance to work hard at something because people were depending on me
- People working together on the same problem disagree - we had to resolve conflicts and move on
- Our solution is the hard work of several people, all woven together
- As the days went past, we got really close (friends for life kinda stuff)

<h2> Kaggle Gets Most Things Right </h2>
</center>
- Kaggle attracts lots of teams
- Large data sets
- Big prizes
<center>
<h2>But they also get a lot of things wrong</h2>
</center>
- In Kaggle you have get anywhere from 5 to 10 test predictions a day (the "leaderboard")
- Data in Kaggle competitions is often big without being complicated
- The data is often processed and feels generic (often it's just a black box)

- It Hasn't been overly processed, needs cleaning
- It isn't given to you in the format that you are "supposed" to use, it's given to you in the format it was collected
- You know what each record means, there are no "f145", "f513" columns

<h2>The DMC data is interesting</h2>
</center>
Both the 2013 and 2014 data sets were incredibly deep.
- There were time dependencies, repeat customers, and other complicated interactions
- Since we could approach the data from multiple angles, we could create a much larger and more unique set of features than anyone could have given us
- Big and complex data is much more fun than just "large memory allocation" data
