</center>

** I Was Taking Two "Big Data" Courses in the Same Semester **
- My professors encouraged participation
- The team I joined that semester came in 5th Place in the Data Mining Cup 

## Why I Kept At It
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Spiral up
- Eventually participated in about a dozen competitions over the next 3 years

## What I Learned by Competing
Regardless of how the team ultimately did, I always got something out of it

- I got comfortable working with real data
  - Feature engineering: taking complicated relationships in the data and getting them into a model
  - Finding ways to compromise between the model you want and the data you have

- Gain experience on the **_statistical pipeline_** instead of the **_statistical smokestack_**
  - building and maintaining databases
  - writing code that other people can read and use (i.e., version control)

- I learned a lot about working with a team
  - Work with people on all sides of my skill set
