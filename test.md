## Why I Started

</center>

** I Was Taking Two "Big Data" Courses in the Same Semester **
- Took two data mining courses during the same semester, hallucinated that I was failing
- My professors encouraged participation
- The team I joined that semester came in 5th Place in the Data Mining Cup 

## Why I Kept At It
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Spiral up
- The next year, our schools team won the Data Mining Cup
- We came in second and third place the year I was the captain
- Eventually participated in about a dozen competitions over the next 3 years

## What I Learned by Competing
Regardless of how the team ultimately did, I always got something out of it

By participating in competitions, I was able to:

- I learned a lot about working with a team:
  - Work with people on all sides of my skill set (multivariate)
  - The importance of staying motivated 

- Become better I learned a lot about working with real data (starting with huge zip files, creating features, etc)

- Gain experience on the **_statistical pipeline_** instead of the **_statistical smokestack_**
  - building and maintaining databases
  - writing code that other people can read and use (i.e., version control)

## The Perfect Test Environment
- These competitions provide a great opportunity to test ideas
- They attract a competitors from a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds
- Here's they key: they end. It's not your thesis, it's not your job, you aren't stuck

## You Get What You Need
- Practice, practice, practice
If you want to get better at something 
It's What You WantYou Have a Chance
of test environment 

types of competitions and I think it's because dIt's possible that no matter what I did

And here's The key takeaway is that I got this 

**
got a lot of information about math skThe competitions gave me a chance to learn things I wouldn't have learned in norma situations
- Software skills for instance
- 

** 
Data mining competitions create a unique opportunity 
`
** You are working with real data **

-  Has the data been processed and homogenized? Variables stripped of meaning? That's awful! It's also real.

-  Is the data messy? Is it hard to understand what the variables even mean? That's real too.

-  Is the data awkward to work with? Is it levels beyond "big", strangely structured? (shh, that's real).

** You are working on a real problem **

-  Somebody, somewhere decided the best way to answer whatever question is posed by the competition is (believe it or not) to make a bunch of people compete with each other
