</center>

** I Was Taking Two "Big Data" Courses in the Same Semester **
- Took two data mining courses during the same semester, hallucinated that I was failing
- My professors encouraged participation
- The team I joined that semester came in 5th Place in the Data Mining Cup 

## Why I Kept At It
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Spiral up
- The next year, our schools team won the Data Mining Cup
- We came in second and third place the year I was the captain
- Eventually participated in about a dozen competitions over the next 3 years

## What I Learned by Competing
Regardless of how the team ultimately did, I always got something out of it

- I got comfortable working with real data
  - Feature engineering: taking complicated relationships in the data and getting them into a model
  - Finding ways to compromise between the model you want and the data you have

- Gain experience on the **_statistical pipeline_** instead of the **_statistical smokestack_**
  - building and maintaining databases
  - writing code that other people can read and use (i.e., version control)

- I learned a lot about working with a team:
  - Work with people on all sides of my skill set (multivariate)
  - The importance of staying motivated

These competitions provide a great opportunity to develop new ideas.

- In a lot of cases capable, intelligent, hard-working people weren't able to see a clear way through.

- If it was just a matter of tuning some stock model, it wouldn't be a competition

- Any good solution is going to have to be based, at least in part, on the creative ideas that result from frustration.

## The Field of Competitors is Open
There are things 

### An Opportunity to Get Out of A Bubble
Because the solution isn't obvious, it may force you to do something you wouldn't normally do
- They attract competitors from a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds

## You Get What You Need
- Practice, practice, practice

It's What You WantYou Have a Chance
of test environment 

types of competitions and I think it's because dIt's possible that no matter what I did

And here's The key takeaway is that I got this 

**
got a lot of information about math skThe competitions gave me a chance to learn things I wouldn't have learned in norma situations
- Software skills for instance
- 

** 
Data mining competitions create a unique opportunity 
`
** You are working with real data **

-  Has the data been processed and homogenized? Variables stripped of meaning? That's awful! It's also real.

-  Is the data messy? Is it hard to understand what the variables even mean? That's real too.

-  Is the data awkward to work with? Is it levels beyond "big", strangely structured? (shh, that's real).

** You are working on a real problem **

-  Somebody, somewhere decided the best way to answer whatever question is posed by the competition is (believe it or not) to make a bunch of people compete with each other
