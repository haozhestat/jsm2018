## Meetings

You *have* to have meetings, they need to be in-person

- People don't read emails, people don't look at each others updates

- Go for in-person meetings because that provides a good opportunity for people to meet and work together.

You *have* to have a lot of meetings

- Schedule them during a regular time

- If the competition is short, once a week isn't going to be enough - try twice a week.

- Twice a week to three times a week is good for big group meetings.

- Meet in pairs as the chance arises: getting with team members to look over problems, etc.

Essentially, the mistake comes when we identify disparge some work as "cleaning" then it's not statistics anymore. The justifications not to are something like this:

> Everyone doesn't need to clean the data, the end result will be exactly the same anyway

- First, where do you draw the line between "_cleaning_" and "_changing_"? I bet we might have different lines.

- Even obvious cases (i.e., an item color is given as `brwon`) provide information about the data as a whole.

- This is much more important in cases where the data structure is complex and awkward (in which case the desire to work with a simpler set is stronger)

**Note**: this does not mean that you can never have preprocessed/clean data sets to work with

- As you might imagine, you will mainly work with data that has been processed in some way.

- Ultimately, though, there should be a general awareness of how the preprocessed set differs from the original.

- Why? Your models are built on data manipulations that start with the raw data.

- Knowing how the raw data is structured gives your team the ability to know imagine exactly how they can extract a structure that they can model.

## What Actually Happens

It may seem like a way to save time and effort at first, but it just doesn't work in the long run with these competitions.

** Route A (Tyranny) **
- The problem becomes alien to the people who didn't work with the raw data
- Feature being created quickly outpace their ability to stay active contributors
- Eventually, all they can do is run models on datasets
- They are reduced to being servers running code (fun!)

** Route B (Revolution) **
- The person "controlling" the data is overwhelmed by the responsibility
- Can't keep up with demands, becomes a bottleneck 
- Resentment builds up until the team falls apart

There are more important things to do at the start of the competition than worry about time.

- The clock running out in a data mining competition is usually merciful instead of stressful.

- The only time it is stressful is when you have a good solution.

### Don't Worry About Repeating Others Work

- No team I have ever been a part of was undone by people doing the same thing

- The first 100 things everyone does are the same anyway (this is good)

- That's OK - you can't manage your way out of that.

- *Bad Idea*: Team Member A does plots for variable X, Team Member B does plots for variable Y

- *Worse Idea*: Team Member A does all the plots and spends a lot of time making them presentable, Team Member B looks at them for 5 minutes. B eventually leaves the team two weeks later because they "got busy with something else".

### Because It Isn't Really Repeated Work

- Analogy: if you go to Australia and show me pictures of your trip, you didn't save me the effort of the trip.

- Even if it's mechanically identical, at some point we'll split off. That's when we both are starting to make progress.

### Prioritize Everyone Understanding the Core Problems

- It's not intuitive, but this means that during the early stages of the competition, you should not pay much attention to people doing what looks like the same thing.

- It may seem like a way to save time and effort at first, but it just doesn't work in the long run with these competitions.

### Don't Delegate
** Do Work Together, Do Volunteer **

Delegating doesn't work

- My general impression is that people do and probably should resent this

- Also: who decides what to delegate? Who knows that much?

If you have an idea but aren't sure how to implement it:

- Bring it up at the team meetings (so vital)

- See if someone doesn't know how to do it (work together)

- If someone has an idea you could help on, do so
