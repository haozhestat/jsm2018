These competitions provide a great opportunity to develop new ideas.

- In a lot of cases capable, intelligent, hard-working people weren't able to see a clear way through.

- If it was just a matter of tuning some stock model, it wouldn't be a competition

- Any good solution is going to have to be based, at least in part, on the creative ideas that result from frustration.

** You are working with real data **

-  Has the data been processed and homogenized? Variables stripped of meaning? That's awful! It's also real.

-  Is the data messy? Is it hard to understand what the variables even mean? That's real too.

-  Is the data awkward to work with? Is it levels beyond "big", strangely structured? (shh, that's real).

The competitions attract people a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds

- CS people do _really_ well in these competitions - there's something to learn from that.

- People with backgrounds in math fields (i.e., cryptology) or physics, too.

- You get to learn a lot about what these people do _outside_ of a text book seeing their solutions.

This is good if you are competitive - you actually have competition and you don't create a toxic environment by competing with your friends/classmates/coworkers

Ultimately you win or lose and it's over. It's something that you get to let go of.

- It's not your research, it's not your thesis, it's not your job, you aren't stuck with it

- Your level of commitment to solving the problem can't extend beyond the deadline. Either you find the best solution or someone else does.

- The things you take away from the competition are yours to keep forever.

Not many opportunities to care deeply about something and then let go of it
